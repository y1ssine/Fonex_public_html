Quickly import live website demo content, widgets and settings with one click.

== Description ==

Ready to go WordPress starter sites and demos.

Quickly import website demo content, widgets, settings and theme customizer options.

This will provide a basic layout to build your website and speed up the development process.

To view the available [Starter Sites](https://wpstartersites.com/), navigate to **Appearance > Starter Sites** in your WordPress dashboard.

== Installation ==

**From your WordPress dashboard**

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New',
2. Search for 'Starter Sites' and install the plugin.
3. Activate 'Starter Sites' from your Plugins page.

Once the plugin is activated you will find the starter sites page in **Appearance -> Starter Sites.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have activated the plugin. Where is the "Starter Sites" page? =

You will find the plugin page at *wp-admin -> Appearance -> Starter Sites*.

= What theme do I need to make use of the Starter Sites? =

Various themes are used in the creation of the starter sites, and you can select any theme/site combination that you like.

= Do I need to install any other plugins? =

Some of the starter sites content will be created with additional 3rd party plugins. An example would be the WooCommerce plugin for ecommerce sites.
You can install the required plugins from the Starter Sites page.

= Where is the Starter Sites content located? =

The preview images and the content files are provided from our cloud server at [WP Starter Sites](https://wpstartersites.com/).
The Starter Sites plugin acts as a service through which you can import and install the website content from our cloud server.
Please also see the [Terms of Use](https://wpstartersites.com/terms-of-use/).

= How does the plugin make use of my data? =

As the preview images and demo content is located on our server, we may receive some non-personal information such as your website URL and/or IP address.
Please see the [Terms of Use](https://wpstartersites.com/terms-of-use/).

= Where are the demo import files and the log files saved? =

The files used in the demo import will be saved to the default WordPress uploads directory. An example of that directory would be: `../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/`.

The log file will also be registered in the *wp-admin -> Media* section, so you can access it easily.

= I can't activate the plugin, because of a fatal error, what can I do? =

*There is an admin error notice, stating that the minimum PHP version required for this plugin is 5.6.*

You want to activate the plugin, but this error shows up:

*Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error*

This happens, because your hosting server is using a very old version of PHP. This plugin requires PHP version of at least **5.6**, but we recommend version *7.2*. Please contact your hosting company and ask them to update the PHP version for your site.
